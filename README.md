### Highlighted Academic Background

**Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Psychology**  
*National University of Distance Education (UNED)*  
_Completed up to the 3rd year_

> **Relevance to Cybersecurity:**  
> My education in Psychology provided me with a solid understanding of cognitive, emotional, and social processes that influence human behavior. This knowledge is essential for analyzing and preventing social engineering attacks, where psychological manipulation is the primary vector.  
>  
> This foundation enables me to design effective strategies for **awareness**, **detection**, and **mitigation** of threats targeting human vulnerabilities, thereby strengthening the overall security of systems and users.
